### Hi there 👋
I'm a Product Designer at [@Appwrite](https://github.com/appwrite) and former mobile developer based in Madrid 🇪🇸 Spain. I'm passionate about applying my programming experience to every project I take on while I transition from developing mobile apps to designing them!

When I'm not at my computer -- which, to be fair, is not often these days -- I love traveling ✈️, hockey 🏒, videogames 👾, baking 🧁, camping 🏕️, and lately I've been dabbling in 3D modelling with Blender (sorry I couldn't find an appropriate blending emoji).
